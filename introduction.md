Introduction
------------

This git repository is to house supplementary materials – mostly R code
– for the paper “A semiparametric modeling approach using Bayesian
Additive Regression Trees with an application to evaluate heterogeneous
treatment effects” by Bret Zeldow, Vincent Lo Re III, and Jason Roy. The
arxiv version is available [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.04200). We
will update the link when accepted to a journal. The code to implement
our method is available at
<a href="https://www.github.com/zeldow/semibart" class="uri">https://www.github.com/zeldow/semibart</a>.
Our code is based off of the [BayesTree
package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/BayesTree/index.html).

What’s included?
----------------

As of March 6, 2019, this git repository will house the simulation code
(data-generating and analaysis), real data analysis code, and
miscellaneous simulation code. The simulation code is organized by table
number in the manuscript (section 4). The analysis code is the code used
to analyze the HIV/HCV data (section 5). Please note that I did not
include the analysis dataset because I do not have permission to post it
publicly. The miscellaneous simulation code is ancillary code that we
used to examine bias estimates when data are simulated with a
tree-structure (in the manuscript, we talk about this in the last two
paragraphs of section 3.3).
