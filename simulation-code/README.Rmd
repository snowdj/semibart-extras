## Purpose

This folder holds all the simulation code in the semi-BART paper. Code for semi-BART is available at https://www.github.com/zeldow/semibart. The code for simulations is organized by table number in the manuscript.

Note: there is a bunch of commented out code that are remnants of simulations past.
