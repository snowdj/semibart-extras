Purpose
-------

This folder holds all the simulation code in the semi-BART paper. Code
for semi-BART is available at
<a href="https://www.github.com/zeldow/semibart" class="uri">https://www.github.com/zeldow/semibart</a>.
The code for simulations is organized by table number in the manuscript.

Note: there is a bunch of commented out code that are remnants of
simulations past.
